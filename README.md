# Video Frame Extractor

This Python script extracts frames from a video file and saves every second frame as an image. It uses OpenCV to process the video and save frames in JPEG format.

## 🚀 Features
- Extracts frames from video files
- Saves every second frame
- Supports custom input and output paths

## 🖥️ Usage
1. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install opencv-python
    ```

2. Set the paths for your video file and output folder in the script:
    ```python
    video_path = r"route"  # Path to your video file
    output_path = r"route"  # Folder to save the frames
    ```

3. Run the script to start extracting frames:
    ```bash
    python DEV-Framer.py
    ```

4. Check the output folder for saved frames.
